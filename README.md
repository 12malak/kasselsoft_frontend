# Job Listing and Blog Management Website

## Project Overview
My colleague Dania and I cooperated to finish this project. We developed a fully responsive, bilingual website (Arabic and English) with an intuitive control panel. The platform allows users to view and manage job listings, control display duration, and sort jobs. Additionally, the control panel includes features for managing blog content, ensuring easy updates and maintenance in both languages.

## Key Features:
- **Bilingual Support**: The website is fully functional in both Arabic and English, making it accessible to a broader audience.
- **Job Management**: Users can post, view, and manage job listings. The control panel allows setting display durations and sorting jobs for easier management.
- **Blog Management**: The control panel simplifies blog content management, allowing admins to edit, update, and remove posts in both languages.
- **Responsive Design**: The platform is fully responsive, offering an optimal user experience across all devices.
